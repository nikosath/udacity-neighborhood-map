# Project: Neighborhood Map

One of the most complex projects for my Udacity Front-End Nanodegree!
In this project I developed a single-page application featuring a map of a neighborhood I am familiar with. It has the following functionality: map markers to identify popular locations, a search function to easily discover these locations, and a listview to support simple browsing of all locations. It also uses the Wikipedia API to provide additional information about each of these locations.

## Usage

You may visit `index.html` at the
[github project page](http://www.nikosath.space/udacity-neighborhood-map/).
As an alternative, you could download/clone the repo files and open
`index.html` in your favorite browser.

# Project: Neighborhood Map

One of the most complex projects for my Udacity Front-End Nanodegree!
In this project I developed a single-page application featuring a map of a
neighborhood I am familiar with. It has the following functionality: map
markers to identify popular locations, a search function to easily discover
these locations, and a listview to support simple browsing of all locations.
It also uses the Wikipedia API to provide additional information about each of
these locations.

## Usage

You may visit `index.html` at the
[github project page](http://www.nikosath.space/udacity-neighborhood-map/).
As an alternative, you can run the app on `localhost:8080` by setting up a local
server by e.g. using one of these Python methods:

* Python 3:

`python -m http.server 8080`

* Python 2:

`python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080`
